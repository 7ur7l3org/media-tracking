TODOs
- remove watchlist double ===== print, fix queue-vote watchlist note to not be json but be the same kind of `imported from trakt-export--2025-01-31T02-36-14Z-7ur7l3/7ur7l3/blah` as the consumed history
- separate the script into convert-history and convert-watchlist and make merge-and-sort-history-and-watchlist. should both use the same cache of wikidata requests
- make convert time to mountain time in whatever format that is
- add trakt json record id to processing log or like just add the `imported from trakt-export--2025-01-31T02-36-14Z-7ur7l3/7ur7l3/watched/history-3.json:7831016969` that will be added to the json but with the word converting instead of imported from
- make logger also output to log file with filename reflective of trakt export and current conversion datetime
- consider renaming title to title_P1476 and description to description_Pblah to be clear where they're coming from.. unless they aren't from those? i can't figure out what the description property is the heck. maybe just itemLabel and itemDescription. eh probably it's just fine
- figure out how shows/one-piece-184618/seasons/1/episodes/1 as a trakt slug is possible to form or exist

-- `"The Mathematician\u2019s Ghost"` how did this happen :/ i thought i fixed that. also `"description": "2020 film directed by Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107"` :/ , `"description": "2010 film by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m"`, `"title": "Fain\u00e9ant.e.s"` -> i had dropped the `, ensure_ascii=False` on all json.dump(s)
